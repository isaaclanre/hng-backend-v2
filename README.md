Hi,

Please to use this script rename the input csv file to "input.csv".

Make sure you have the latest version of node installed on your computer

While in this directory run "npm run generate" from the command line interface

If the previous line is successful you will find the output file named "filename.output.csv" in this same directory.

Thank you for using this script.
